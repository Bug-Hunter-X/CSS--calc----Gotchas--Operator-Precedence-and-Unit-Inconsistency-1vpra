The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit usage.  For instance, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 20%);` might not.  The latter subtracts 20% of the *element's width* which is not yet defined when it's evaluated. This can lead to a zero width or unexpected width calculations in many cases. Another common mistake is mixing different units within the same `calc()` expression without proper conversion, leading to errors.
